            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It allows you to revert files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. Version control systems most commonly run as stand-alone applications, but revision control is also embedded in various types of software such as word processors and spreadsheets. Using a VCS also means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover them.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a widely-used source code management system for software development. It is a distributed revision control system with an emphasis on speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. Git began with a bit of creative destruction and fiery controversy. Due to controversy with another program a company was using, they decided to develop their own tool. Some of the goals of the new system were as follows: speed, simple design, strong support for non-linear development, fully distributed, and able to handle large projects. Since its birth in 2005, Git has evolved and matured to be easy to use and yet retain these initial qualities. It’s incredibly fast, it’s very efficient with large projects, and it has an incredible branching system for non-linear development.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">When a repository is created with files and directories, developers can record their change history and start tracking their status and versions. A remote repository is a repository that resides on a remote server that is shared among multiple team members. A local repository is a repository that resides on a local machine of an individual user. There are two ways to create a local repository. You can create a brand new one, or clone an existing remote repository onto your local machine. Everything is local, so you can work offline. Git will prevent an unintentional overwrite of a file on the shared repository.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Basics</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git stores and thinks about information much differently than other systems such as Subversion and Perforce, even though the user interface is fairly similar, and understanding those differences will help prevent you from becoming confused while using it. The major difference between Git and any other VCS is the way Git thinks about its data. Most other systems store information as a list of file-based changes. These systems think of the information they keep as a set of files and the changes made to each file over time. Git doesn’t think of or store its data this way. Instead, Git thinks of its data more like a set of snapshots of a miniature filesystem. Every time you commit, or save the state of your project in Git, it basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">While there are many basic and remote Git commands, there are three main commands that you can do a lot with. The three basic commands are add, commit, and push. The add command allows a user to add one or more files to the staging or index. Commit any files you've added with git add, and also commit any files you've changed since then. The final step, push, sends changes to the master branch of your remote repository. With these simple, three steps, you can save your work along the way so you have a copyboy can revert back to.</p>
